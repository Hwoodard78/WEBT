        <h2>Introduction to Grendel</h2>
        <p>Grendel is the 42nd Warframe, added to the game with Update 26.0 on Halloween 2019.
        Named after the famous monster from Beowulf, Grendel is the epitomy of Gluttony and power. With impressive stats and a wide range of abilities,
        this page aims to showcase why in my personal opinion, Grendel is the best thing to be added to Warframe</p>
